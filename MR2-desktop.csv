https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1356267,2021-11-02 04:22:39 UTC,"<p>I'm pretty sure this is a Firefox Relay extension problem. I used the relay extension for my Weebly website. Now, when I go to sign in, it no longer recognizes my user name and says there has been an error - that my user name is incorrect. The situation has not changed when I turn off Relay Extension and restart Firefox. I used the relay address to sign in just for the heck of it, and that doesn't work either. I can log into my Weebly site with Safari though - which means that something went wrong with Firefox and not Weebly. I had also used Relay on my Craigslist account and my accounts were automatically shut down. At the time, I did not think it was due to the Relay, but now I wonder. I had to open a new account with a new email address in order to use Craigslist again. (I have an ongoing ad). Anyway, I think there might be something wrong with Relay.

After it a kind of light gray filter layer is added to the screen. It's possible to scroll down the page, but all buttons/links on it are disabled.
Using Google Chrome previous described mistake does not occur.  Instead a cookie popup appears and after accepting, the normal homepage appears. So it seems that some sites are freezing their home page by the gray overlay in order to force the user to accept/reject the cookies. But when Firefox skips the cookie popup you're always blocked. 
Do you see a solution for a user of sutch sites?

The FF window is covering the location where I want to put my cursor to work on that page that is in the background.  In this case, I wanted to make sure the cursor was positioned in a different place for another screenshot I might put there (below the existing one).

https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1356348,2021-11-02 14:12:17 UTC,"<p>Hello - I've been unable to stream Twitch content on Firefox 94 for the last day or so, however, the issue impacts Youtube and Vimeo live feeds as well.
</p><p>1.	No outages in my area (Twitch works fine on my phone)
2.	Tried Firefox in Troubleshoot mode (which disables all extensions) Twitch still broke.
3.	Tried Incognito and Troubleshoot mode, Twitch still broke.
4.	Cleared cookies and cache, plus Incognito and Troubleshoot mode, Twitch still broke.
5.	Tried a different browser, Twitch works fine on Edge
6.	I tried all of the above using a 4G Hotspot instead of my fibre connection, same issue
</p><p>I’ve done some side by side testing of Edge and Firefox today, streaming the same content on each at the same time.  Twitch runs fine on Edge.  Twitch loads on Firefox and the chat looks fine.  The chat arrives simultaneously on Edge and Firefox, it’s just the audio and video won’t play on Firefox.  The audio and video don’t work on the ads either.
</p><p>Watching a Youtube game stream side by side on both Edge and Firefox gives a slightly different result.  Again, the chat feed is almost simultaneous, maybe a fraction faster on Firefox.  However, while the audio and video run fine on both Edge and Firefox, there is a 15 second lag on Firefox.  Both are playing full 1080 video.
</p><p>So there is a definite issue with how Firefox is buffering audio/video content.  The 15 second delay between the audio video stream and the chat I am seeing today with Youtube is what I was experiencing on Twitch over the weekend.  I noticed it on streams that include a chat window on the video.  I wasn’t overly concerned about the latency issue, as long as I had audio and video.  Both of those stopped working for Twitch on Firefox yesterday.  It could be that Twitch has slightly richer content than Youtube and that’s why Twitch isn’t working at all on Firefox?
</p><p>OK, so I’ve installed the Twitch app for Windows and done some side by side testing with that.  Interestingly, the app has a couple of seconds latency over Edge but it works fine.  I shall use the app for now but would prefer to use Firefox if the buffering/streaming issues can be resolved.
