1)add a simple switch for always desktop mode for every website....i am not the first one and i am sure i am not the only one who is tired of ur excuuses not to add a switch......https://<a href=""http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1286164.......bydeway"" rel=""nofollow"">support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1286164.......bydeway</a> the instruction s you gave didint work.....not that it mathers cuz it should be build in.....imagine if you brought ur car to the workshop...and the technician comes to you handles you a wrenge and tells you how to manualy change compression in ur cilinders.............if you managed to not break ur engine i am pretty sure you going to rate the workshop as 5 stars for customer service...where did the time go where the customer decidit what features he wanted in a product.......
2)second let firefox Android check resolution after first instal...so bye default place the switch to desktop mode after high resolution tablet/detection
3)enable background playing while on other tab.....like brave supports
</p><p>If the above issues dont get solvedi will uninstall firefox......
